Designing a computer system is very different from designing an algorithm: The
external interface (that is, the requirement) is less precisely defined, more
complex, and more subject to change. The system has much more internal
structure, and hence many internal interfaces. The measure of success is much
less clear.[38;5;8m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m
%
There probably isn't a 'best' way to build the system, or even any major part
of it; much more important is to avoid choosing a terrible way, and to have
clear division of responsibilities among the parts.[38;5;8m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m
%
Defining interfaces is the most important part of system design. Usually it is
also the most difficult, since the interface design must satisfy three
conflicting requirements: an interface should be simple, it should be complete,
and it should admit a sufficiently small and fast implementation. Alas, all too
often the assumptions embodied in an interface turn out to be misconceptions
instead.[38;5;8m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m
%
The main reason interfaces are difficult to design is that each interface is a
small programming language: it defines a set of objects and the operations that
can be used to manipulate the objects. Concrete syntax is not an issue, but
every other aspect of programming language design is present.
[38;5;8m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m
%
Do one thing at a time, and do it well. An interface should capture the minimum
essentials of an abstraction. Don't generalize; generalizations are generally
wrong.[38;5;8m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m
%
When an interface undertakes to do too much its implementation will probably be
large, slow and complicated. An interface is a contract to deliver a certain
amount of service; clients of the interface depend on the contract, which is
usually documented in the interface specification. They also depend on
incurring a reasonable cost (in time or other scarce resources) for using the
interface; the definition of 'reasonable' is usually not documented anywhere.
If there are six levels of abstraction, and each costs 50% more than is
'reasonable', the service delivered at the top will miss by more than a factor
of 10.[38;5;8m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m
%
Service must have a fairly predictable cost, and the interface must not promise
more than the implementer knows how to deliver. Especially, it should not
promise features needed by only a few clients, unless the implementer knows how
to provide them without penalizing others. A better implementer, or one who
comes along ten years later when the problem is better understood, might be
able to deliver, but unless the one you have can do so, it is wise to reduce
your aspirations.[38;5;8m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m

Exterminate features.[38;5;8m - Charles P. Thacker[0m

Perfection must be reached by degrees; she requires the slow hand of time.
[38;5;8m - Voltaire[0m
%
Keep secrets of the implementation. Secrets are assumptions about an
implementation that client programs are not allowed to make. In other words,
they are things that can change; the interface defines the things that cannot
change (without simultaneous changes to both implementation and client).
Obviously, it is easier to program and modify a system if its parts make fewer
assumptions about each other. On the other hand, the system may not be easier
to design - it's hard to design a good interface. And there is a tension with
the desire not to hide power.[38;5;8m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m
%
One way to improve performance is to increase the number of assumptions that
one part of a system makes about another; the additional assumptions often
allow less work to be done, sometimes a lot less. For instance, if a set of
size n is known to be sorted, a membership test takes time log n rather than n.
This technique is very important in the design of algorithms and the tuning of
small modules. In a large system the ability to improve each part separately is
usually more important. Striking the right balance remains an art.

Divide and conquer. A well known method for solving a hard problem: reduce it

Nearly every non-trivial system has more specialized applications of caching.
This is especially true for interactive or real-time systems, in which the
basic problem is to incrementally update a complex state in response to
frequent small changes. Doing this in an ad-hoc way is extremely error-prone.
The best organizing principle is to recompute the entire state after each
change but cache all the expensive results of this computation.
[38;5;8m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m
%
Compute in background when possible. In an interactive or real-time system, it
is good to do as little work as possible before responding to a request. The
reason is twofold: first, a rapid response is better for the users, and second,
the load usually varies a great deal, so there is likely to be idle processor
time later in which to do background work. Many kinds of work can be deferred
to background.[38;5;8m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m

Safety first. In allocating resources, strive to avoid disaster rather than to
attain an optimum. Many years of experience with virtual memory, networks, disk
allocation, database layout, and other resource allocation problems has made it
clear that a general-purpose system cannot optimize the use of resources.

Shed load to control demand, rather than allowing the system to become
overloaded. There are many ways to shed load. An interactive system can refuse
new users, or even deny service to existing ones. A memory manager can limit
the jobs being served so that all their working sets fit in the available
memory. A network can discard packets. If it comes to the worst, the system can
crash and start over more prudently.[38;5;8m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m

Creative, interactive communication requires a plastic or moldable medium that
can be modeled, a dynamic medium in which premises will flow into consequences,

By far the most numerous, most sophisticated, and most important models are
those that reside in men's minds. In richness, plasticity, facility, and
economy, the mental model has no peer, but, in other respects, it has short-
comings. It will not stand still for careful study. It cannot be made to repeat
a run. No one knows just how it works. It serves its owner's hopes more
faithfully than it serves reason. It has access only to the information stored
in one man's head. It can be observed and manipulated only by one person.
Society rightly distrusts the modeling done by a single mind. Society demands
consensus, agreement, at least majority. Fundamentally, this amounts to the
requirement that individual models be compared and brought into some degree of
accord. The requirement is for communication, which we now define concisely as
'cooperative modeling' - cooperation in the construction, maintenance, and use
of a model.[38;5;8m - J.C.R. Licklider and R. W. Taylor (1968)[0m

It is the fundamental role of a system designer to determine how to break down
a system into components and layers; to make decisions about what to build and
what to pick up from elsewhere. An important element in large scale engineering
is understanding how these decisions will play out over time. Change
fundamentally underlies everything we do as programmers, so these design
choices are not only evaluated in the moment, but are evaluated in the years to
come as the product continues to evolve.[38;5;8m - Terry Crowley[0m
%
Layers (or abstractions) are fundamentally leaky. These leaks have consequences
immediately but also have consequences over time, in two ways. One consequence
is that the characteristics of the layer leak through and permeate more of the
system than you realize. These might be assumptions about specific performance
characteristics or behavior ordering that is not an explicit part of the layer
contract. This means that you generally are more vulnerable to changes in the
internal behavior of the component that you understood. A second consequence is
it also means you are more dependent on that internal behavior than is obvious,
so if you consider changing that layer the consequences and challenges are
probably larger than you thought.[38;5;8m - Terry Crowley[0m
%
Layers are too functional. A component you adopt will have more functionality
than you actually require. In some cases, the decision to use it is based on
leveraging that functionality for future uses. You adopt specifically because
you want to 'get on the train' and leverage the ongoing work that will go into
that component. Consequences: 1) The component will often make trade-offs that
are biased by functionality that you do not actually require. 2) The component
will embed complexity and constraints because of functionality you do not
require and those constraints will impede future evolution of that component.
3) There will be more surface area to leak into your application. Some of that
leakage will be due to true 'leaky abstractions' and some will be explicit (but
generally poorly controlled) increased dependence on the full capabilities of
the component.[38;5;8m - Terry Crowley[0m

Layers get replaced. Requirements evolve, systems evolve, components are
abandoned. You eventually need to replace that layer or component. This is true
for external component dependencies as well as internal ones.[38;5;8m - Terry Crowley[0m

Much of performance analysis is about three things: locality, locality,
locality. Whether it is packing data on disk, managing processor cache
hierarchies, or coalescing data into a communications packet, how data is
packed together, the patterns for how you touch that data with locality over
time and the patterns of how you transfer that data between components is
fundamental to performance. Focusing on less code operating on less data with
more locality over space and time is a good way to cut through the noise.

%
Caches are fundamental but also dangerous. Caches are trying to leverage the
runtime behavior of the code to change the pattern of interaction between
different components in the system. They inherently need to model that
behavior, even if that model is implicit in how they fill and invalidate the
cache and test for a cache hit. If the model is poor or becomes poor as the
behavior changes, the cache will not operate as expected. A simple guideline is
that caches must be instrumented‚Ää-‚Äätheir behavior will degrade over time
because of changing behavior of the application and the changing nature and
balance of the performance characteristics of the components you are modeling.
Every long-time programmer has cache horror stories.[38;5;8m - Terry Crowley[0m

Light speed analysis: What is the best theoretical performance I could achieve
with this design? What is the real information content being transferred and at
what rate of change? What is the underlying latency and bandwidth between
components? Could the approach ever achieve the performance goals or does it

building blocks rather than focusing on functional characteristics.

The human visual and nervous system [is] inherently constrained, which means a
system designer can leverage (must leverage) those constraints, e.g. by
virtualization (limiting how much of the underlying data model needs to be

the perception limits of the human visual system.[38;5;8m - Terry Crowley[0m

I have struggled with complexity my entire career. One of our key approaches
for managing complexity is to 'walk away' and start fresh. Often new tools or
languages force us to start from scratch which means that developers end up
conflating the benefits of the tool with the benefits of the clean start. The
clean start is what is fundamental. The simplest way of controlling complexity
growth is to build a smaller system with fewer developers.[38;5;8m - Terry Crowley[0m

I used to say my job was to design feedback loops. Transparent processes [are]
a great tool for empowerment‚Ää-‚Ääthe manager can invest more and more local
control in those closest to the problem because of confidence they have
visibility to the progress being made. Coordination emerges naturally. Key to
this is that the goal has actually been properly framed (including key resource
constraints like ship schedule). Decision-making that needs to constantly flow
up and down the management chain usually reflects poor framing of goals and
constraints by management.[38;5;8m - Terry Crowley on technical management[0m
%
One dirty little secret you learn as you move up the management ladder is that
you and your new peers aren't suddenly smarter because you now have more
responsibility. This reinforces that the organization as a whole better be
smarter than the leader at the top. Empowering every level to own their
decisions within a consistent framing is the key approach to making this true.
Listening and making yourself accountable to the organization for articulating
and explaining the reasoning behind your decisions is another key strategy.
Surprisingly, fear of making a dumb decision can be a useful motivator for
ensuring you articulate your reasoning clearly and make sure you listen to all
inputs.[38;5;8m - Terry Crowley on technical management[0m

Crowley's 1st rule of distributed systems design: Think through the
implications to the user experience from the start rather than trying to patch
on error handling, cancellation and status reporting as an afterthought.
%
Crowley's 2nd rule of distributed systems design: Use asynchronous techniques
to couple components. Synchronous coupling is impossible. If something appears
synchronous, it's because some internal layer has tried to hide the asynchrony
and in doing so has obscured (but definitely not hidden) a fundamental
characteristic of the runtime behavior of the system.
%
Crowley's 3rd rule of distributed systems design: Recognize and explicitly
design for interacting state machines. These states represent robust long-lived
internal system states (rather than ad-hoc, ephemeral and undiscoverable state
encoded by the value of variables in a deep call stack).
%
Crowley's 4th rule of distributed systems design: Failure is expected. The only
guaranteed way to detect failure in a distributed system is to simply decide
you have waited 'too long'. This naturally means that cancellation is first-
class. Some layer of the system (perhaps plumbed through to the user) will need
to decide it has waited too long and cancel the interaction. Cancelling is only
about reestablishing local state and reclaiming local resources‚Ää-‚Ääthere is no
way to reliably propagate that cancellation through the system. It can
sometimes be useful to have a low-cost, unreliable way to attempt to propagate
cancellation as a performance optimization.
%
Crowley's 5th rule of distributed systems design: Cancellation is not rollback
since it is just reclaiming local resources and state. If rollback is
necessary, it needs to be an end-to-end feature.
%
Crowley's 6th rule of distributed systems design: You can never really know the
state of a distributed component. As soon as you discover the state, it may
have changed. When you send an operation, it may be lost in transit, it might
be processed but the response is lost, or it may take some significant amount
of time to process so the remote state ultimately transitions at some arbitrary
time in the future. This leads to approaches like idempotent operations and the
ability to robustly and efficiently rediscover remote state rather than
expecting that distributed components can reliably track state in parallel. The
concept of 'eventual consistency' succinctly captures many of these ideas.

UML - I know next to nothing about UML - but what I do know is the language was

language. Well, in other words what that means is that the language was
invented first and it really didn't mean anything. And then, later on, people
came around to try to figure out what it meant. Well, that's not the way to
design a specification language. The importance of a specification language is
to specify something precisely, and therefore what you write - the
specification you write - has to have a precise, rigorous meaning.

You could decide that you want to do something - the what - and then when it
comes to programming it you discover that you can't - that is, you don't know
how or the how is too expensive or something like that. So I don't mean to
imply that what you should first do is thinking completely abstractly about
what something is supposed to do and then, only then do you think about how you
do it. Part of engineering is understanding what you can do in practice and
what you can't. But, given that caveat, you really should understand what the
system is doing before you try to implement it.[38;5;8m - Leslie Lamport[0m

It's really important to understand what something is supposed to do before you
start to do it. Very often, once you've decided precisely what something is
supposed to do, implementing it - the coding, the how - is quite trivial, and
it hardly needs a specification at all or might be so simple that you really
can just start coding without writing any precise description of how it does
it, beyond the specification of what it's supposed to do.[38;5;8m - Leslie Lamport[0m
%
First of all, there are lots of different things that can go by the name of
specification. I use all of them. Sometimes a specification I write is a few
English sentences. Sometimes, it's a very complicated mathematical description
of the object, the what or the how. Which one is appropriate depends on the
problem: how hard the problem is, how important it is that it get done
correctly, and various things like that.[38;5;8m - Leslie Lamport[0m

Generally it doesn't seem to be necessary to deal with Byzantine failures.
Using simple techniques like checksums to avoid corruption of data, it's
generally felt that that kind of malicious behavior, outside of - where the
malice is caused by failure not by hackers - you don't need Byzantine fault
tolerance. So, in practice that means if the computers that you're building
your system out of are under your control and not under hackers' control then
you don't need Byzantine fault tolerance, in which case Paxos is basically the
algorithm you should be using. There are different consensus algorithms that
have been proposed but the ones that are practical in the sense that they're
efficient are all equivalent to Paxos at least in the normal case, and Paxos
works: use that. I mean it doesn't solve all your problems, because you still
have the problem of optimizing: there are lots of optimization games you can
play depending upon the particular nature of the state machine you're trying to
implement, but if you understand the basic Paxos algorithm then you'll
understand what optimizations can be made to get it to work well for your
system.[38;5;8m - Leslie Lamport[0m

complicated machines, but there's a lot simpler way to describe systems,

Computation is not just about functions. If computation were about functions

sequence of states and what an assignment statement is doing is it is telling
you here is a new state, and also there's the notion of its non-determinism, so
the new state is not a function of the old state. So functional programming in

notion that all the growth of the financial sector in the last forty years has
been beneficial to society. In fact, we have both theoretical reasons and
empirical evidence to claim that a component has been pure rent seeking. By

life and death question for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer
work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the remotest
zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every
quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of
the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products
of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion
and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-

The objectivity of science is [...] the social result of mutual criticism, of
the friendly-hostile division of labour among scientists, of their co-operation
and also of their competition... Objectivity can only be explained in terms of
social ideas such as competition (both of individual scientists and of various
schools of thoughts); tradition (that is the critical tradition); social
institutions (for instance, publications in various competing journals and by
various competing publishers; discussions at congresses); the power of the
state (that is, its political tolerance of free discussion).

avoid error is to detect it and that the only way to detect it is to be free to

Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by
task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same
fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and
scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research.
Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes
virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard
there are now hundreds of new electronic computers. The prospect of domination
of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the
power of money is ever present - and is gravely to be regarded. Yet, in holding
scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be
alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become

The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty,
and this experience is of very great importance, I think. When a scientist
doesn‚Äôt know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to
what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty darn sure of what
the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt. We have found it of
paramount importance that in order to progress we must recognize our ignorance
and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of
varying degrees of certainty ‚Äì some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none
absolutely certain. Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for
granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to
live and not know. But I don't know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our
freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days
of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question ‚Äì to
doubt ‚Äì to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this
struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained.[38;5;8m - Richard Feynman[0m

use up 20 sheets or more per hour when I'm exploring a problem, especially at
the beginning. For the first hour I'm trying all kinds of stuff and looking for
patterns. Later, after internalizing those calculations or drawings or whatever
they are, I don't have to write quite so much down, and I'm getting closer to a
solution. The best test of when I'm about ready to solve a problem is whether
or not I can think about it sensibly while swimming, without any paper or notes

symbols, in the same way that a mathematician solves equations by replacing
expressions by other expressions. Incorporate preexisting knowledge into
learning, and combine different pieces of knowledge on the fly in order to
solve new problems. Master algorithm is inverse deduction, which figures out
what knowledge is missing in order to make a deduction go through, and then
make it as general as possible. 1:1 concept:symbol. Sequential process.

output with the desired one and then successively changes the connections. 1:n

%
Lampson's Law - Corollary of Speed: Make it fast, rather than general or
powerful. If it's fast, the client can program the function it wants, and
another client can program some other function. It is much better to have basic
operations executed quickly than more powerful ones that are slower (of course,
a fast, powerful operation is best, if you know how to get it). The trouble
with slow, powerful operations is that the client who doesn‚Äôt want the power
pays more for the basic function. Usually it turns out that the powerful
operation is not the right one.[38;5;8m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m
%
Lampson's Law - Corollary of Power: Don't hide power. When a low level of
abstraction allows something to be done quickly, higher levels should not bury
this power inside something more general. The purpose of abstractions is to
conceal undesirable properties; desirable ones should not be hidden. Sometimes,
of course, an abstraction is multiplexing a resource, and this necessarily has
some cost. But it should be possible to deliver all or nearly all of it to a

an interface, eliminating a jumble of parameters that amount to a small
programming language. A simple example is an enumeration procedure that returns
all the elements of a set satisfying some property. The cleanest interface
allows the client to pass a filter procedure that tests for the property,
rather than defining a special language of patterns or whatever.

processes including those on computers, but also in Biology, society, etc. His
idea was that computing formed a wonderful facility for making better models of
pretty much everything, especially dynamic things (which everything actually
is), and that it was also the kind of thing that could really be understood
much better by using it to make models of itself. Today, we could still take
this as a starting place for "getting 'Computer Science' back from where it was

Keep basic interfaces stable. Since an interface embodies assumptions that are
shared by more than one part of a system, and sometimes by a great many parts,
it is very desirable not to change the interface.[38;5;8m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m
%
Keep a place to stand if you do have to change interfaces. One is the
compatibility package, which implements an old interface on top of a new
system. This allows programs that depend on the old interface to continue
working. Many new operating systems have kept old software usable by simulating
the supervisor calls of an old system. Usually these simulators need only a
small amount of effort compared to the cost of reimplementing the old software,
and it is not hard to get acceptable performance. At a different level, the IBM
360/370 systems provided emulation of the instruction sets of older machines
like the 1401 and 7090. Taken a little further, this leads to virtual machines,
which simulate (several copies of) a machine on the machine itself.

The preconditions of revolution exist in the UK, and most western countries.
The number of active pre-conditions is quite stunning, from elite isolation to
concentrated wealth to inadequate socialisation and education, to concentrated
land holdings to loss of authority to repression of new technologies especially
in relation to energy, to the atrophy of the public sector and spread of
corruption, to media dishonesty, to mass unemployment of young men and on and
on and on. [...] Preconditions are not the same as precipitants. We are waiting
for our Tunisian fruit seller. The public will endure great repression,
especially when most media outlets and schools are actively aiding the
repressive meme of 'you are helpless, this is the order of things.' When we
have a scandal so powerful that it cannot be ignored by the average Briton or
American, we will have a revolution that overturns the corrupt political
systems in both countries, and perhaps puts many banks out of business. Vaclav
Havel calls this 'The Power of the Powerless.' One spark, one massive fire.

Wealth creates a leisure class that 'buys' knowledge and defines irrational

Today, having abdicated concepts of the good, the beautiful, and the true for a

Language, an internal system of the mind, is independent of externalization and
basically provides expressions of linguistically formulated thought. As such,
it is a system of pure structure, lacking linear order and other arrangements
that are not really part of language as such but are imposed by requirements of
the articulatory system (sign, which uses visual space, exploits some other
options). Internal language is based on recursive operations that yield what we
called the Basic Property of language: generation of an infinite array of
hierarchically structured expressions that are interpreted as thoughts. The
externalization system for language has no recursive operations - it is,
basically, a deterministic mapping that introduces linear order and other
arrangements that are required by the output system.[38;5;8m - Noam Chomsky (2019)[0m

Sin #1 - Unnecessary distributed parallelism: It does not always make sense to
parallelize a computation. Doing so almost inevitably comes with an additional
overhead, both in runtime performance and in engineering time. When designing a
parallel implementation, its performance should always be compared to an
optimized serial implementation in order to understand the overheads involved.
If we satisfy ourselves that parallel processing is necessary, it is also worth
considering whether distribution over multiple machines is required. The rapid
increase in RAM and CPU cores can make local parallelism economical and
worthwhile. Establish the need for distributed parallelism on a case by case
basis.[38;5;8m - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research'

Sin #2 - Assuming performance homogeneity: Virtualized cloud environments
exhibit highly variable and sometimes unpredictable performance. Base reported
results on multiple benchmark runs, and report the variance.[38;5;8m - Schwarzkopf et

Sin #3 - Picking the low-hanging fruit: It is unsurprising that it is easy to
beat a general system by specializing it. Few researchers comment on the
composability of their solutions. [38;5;8m - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins
of cloud computing research' (2014)[0m
%
Sin #4 - Forcing the abstraction: In some application domains, it is unclear if
a MapReduce-like approach can offer any benefits, and indeed, some have argued
that it is fruitless as a research direction. Ideally, future research should
build on [iterative processing, stream processing and graph processing], rather
than on the MapReduce paradigm.[38;5;8m - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of
cloud computing research' (2014)[0m

Sin #5 - Unrepresentative workloads: The common assumption in academic research
systems is that the cluster workload is relatively homogenous. Most research
evaluations measure performance by running a single job on an otherwise idle
cluster.[38;5;8m - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing
research' (2014)[0m
%
Sin #6 - Assuming perfect elasticity: The cloud paradigm [...] its promise of
an unlimited supply of computation. This is, of course, a fallacy. Workloads do
not exhibit infinite parallel speedup. The scalability and supply of compute
resources are not infinite. There are limits to the scalability of data center
communication infrastructure. Another reason for diminishing returns from
parallelization is the increasing likelihood of failures and vulnerability to
"straggler" tasks. [38;5;8m - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud
computing research' (2014)[0m
%
Sin #7 - Ignoring fault tolerance: Many recent systems neglect to account for
the performance implications of fault tolerance, or indeed of faults occurring.
For each system, we should ask whether fault tolerance is relevant or required.
If it is, it makes sense to check precisely what level is required, and what
faults are to be protected against; consider and ideally quantify the cost.

Ownership: Think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term

%
Invent and Simplify: Expect and require innovation and invention from your
teams and always find ways to simplify. Be externally aware, look for new ideas
from everywhere, and don't be limited by "not invented here." As we do new
things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

stay fixed.[38;5;8m - Amazon leadership principle[0m

The experienced operator makes the minimum number of actions, and the process
output moves smoothly and quickly to the new level, while with an inexperienced
